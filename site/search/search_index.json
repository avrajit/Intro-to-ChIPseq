In addition to running the ChIP-seq workflow from FASTQ files to peak calls and nearest gene annotations, the workshop covers best practice guidlelines for ChIP-seq experimental design and data organization/management and quality control.\n\n\n\n\nThese materials were developed for a trainer-led workshop, but are also amenable to self-guided learning.\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nUnderstand the necessity for, and use of, the command line interface (bash) and HPC for analyzing high-throughput sequencing data.\n\n\nUnderstand best practices for designing a ChIP-seq experiment and analysis the resulting data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese materials have been developed by members of the teaching team at the \nHarvard Chan Bioinformatics Core (HBC)\n.
