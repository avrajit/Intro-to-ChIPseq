This workshop focuses on teaching basic computational skills to enable the effective use of an high-performance computing environment to implement a ChIP-seq data analysis workflow. It includes an introduction to shell (bash) and shell scripting. In addition to running the ChIP-seq workflow from FASTQ files to peak calls and nearest gene annotations, the workshop covers best practice guidlelines for ChIP-seq experimental design and data organization/management and quality control.\n\n\n\n\nThese materials were developed for a trainer-led workshop, but are also amenable to self-guided learning.\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nUnderstand the necessity for, and use of, the command line interface (bash) and HPC for analyzing high-throughput sequencing data.\n\n\nUnderstand best practices for designing a ChIP-seq experiment and analysis the resulting data.\n\n\n\n\nLessons\n\n\nClick here\n for links to lessons and the suggested schedule\n\n\n\n\nThese materials have been developed by members of the teaching team at the \nHarvard Chan Bioinformatics Core (HBC)\n.
